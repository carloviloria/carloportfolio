        <h2>Hello, I'm Carlo Viloria</h2>

    <section id="about">
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Prior to that, I completed my Associate's Degree at Honolulu Community College, where I spent two formative years developing my foundation in tech. I've always been passionate about technology, gaming, and music, and I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in the tech or computer science industry. I'm also open to internships and co-op roles that allow me to grow and apply my skills in real-world settings.</p>

            <p>I consider myself a quick learner who's always eager to improve. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with others toward a shared goal. I'm excited to contribute to a team and grow alongside it as I continue my journey in the tech world.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of tech, I love gaming, music, and spending quality time with friends and family. Growing up in Hawai'i, I enjoy heading to the beach, running outdoors, and soaking up the sun whenever I can. I'm also a big fan of volleyball—both as a player and a spectator. When I'm indoors, you'll probably find me playing League of Legends or replaying some of my favorite classic games. I'm always up for a conversation about music, games, or volleyball.</p>
            
            <p>A fun fact about me: I played as the ADC for the University of Hawai'i Esports League of Legends team before the pandemic paused our competitions. It was one of the most memorable and rewarding experiences I've had.</p>

                <h3>Academia Arena</h3>
                <p>Academia Arena is a web application designed to bridge the gap between students and their professors. Mainly focusing on the ICS department, the concept is a trading card game where the cards are the professors with details such as their name, classes they teach, and a fun fact about themselves. The cards also have different rarities depending on how many students are able to attend their respective classes. With this application, we are hoping for students to find more interest in the classes these professors teach and possibly help network them to different professors.</p>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Card Collection:</b> Collect cards of professors from the ICS department, each with unique details and rarities.</li>
                    <li><b>Networking:</b> Connect with professors and other students through the platform.</li>
                    <li><b>Fun Facts:</b> Discover interesting facts about professors to make learning more engaging.</li>
                    <li><b>Knowledge is Power:</b> In order to collect cards, students must pass a quiz to collect enough points to pull one random card out of a pool.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How it Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Make an Account:</b> Sign up on the website to get started.</li>
                    <li><b>Tryout the Quiz:</b> Once logged in, try the quiz and get your first card</li>
                    <li><b>Explore the other features:</b> With your card, you could explore the marketplace where you could trade cards that other students have or may not have and could also request a card for the one you currently have.</li>
                    <li><b>Collect!</b> The whole point of this web application is to collect all the cards and to know your professor better! We also aim for you to connect with other students on campus as well.</li>
