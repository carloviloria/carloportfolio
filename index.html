        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent grad of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science. I also hold an Associates Degree when I attended Honolulu Community College for two years. A couple of things about me is that I am interested in all things tech, gaming, and music. I am currently looking for a full-time position in the tech or computer science industry. I am open to any opportunities that come my way. I am also interested in internships and co-op positions as well. I am a quick learner and I am always looking to improve my skills. I am also a team player and I enjoy working with others to achieve a common goal. I am excited to see what the future holds for me in the tech industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        Things outside of tech that I enjoy are playing video games, listening to music, and spending time with my family and friends. As someone who is from Hawaii, I enjoy going to the beach and spending time outdoors and running out in the sun in my freetime. I also have a passionate interest in volleyball as a spectator and player. If I am not outside I am usually playing League of Legends or replaying classic video games that are near dear to my heart. I like talking about everything music, volleyball, and video games related. One little fun fact about me is that I played for our college's UH Esports team for League of Legends. I was the ADC player for our team for a year before the pandemic hit.

            <h3>Academia Arena</h3>
            <p>Academia Arena is a web application designed to bridge the gap between students and their professors. Mainly focusing on the ICS department, the concept is a trading card game where the cards are the professors with details such as their name, classes they teach, and a fun fact about themselves. The cards also have different rarities depending on how many students are able to attend their respective classes. With this application, we are hoping for students to find more interest in the classes these professors teach and possibly help network them to different professors.</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Card Collection:</b> Collect cards of professors from the ICS department, each with unique details and rarities.</li>
                <li><b>Networking:</b> Connect with professors and other students through the platform.</li>
                <li><b>Fun Facts:</b> Discover interesting facts about professors to make learning more engaging.</li>
                <li><b>Knowledge is Power:</b> In order to collect cards, students must pass a quiz to collect enough points to pull one random card out of a pool.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Make an Account:</b> Sign up on the website to get started.</li>
                <li><b>Tryout the Quiz:</b> Once logged in, try the quiz and get your first card</li>
                <li><b>Explore the other features:</b> With your card, you could explore the marketplace where you could trade cards that other students have or may not have and could also request a card for the one you currently have.</li>
                <li><b>Collect!</b> The whole point of this web application is to collect all the cards and to know your professor better! We also aim for you to connect with other students on campus as well.</li>
            </ul>
